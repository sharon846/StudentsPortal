   - SITE_DOMAIN, with your domain adress.
   - SITE_SESSION_NAME, with a session name for your choice.
   - SITE_ENC_KEY with some encryption key, to protect personal links in mail sending.
   - SITE_NAME with your site name (i.e. StudDept).
   - DEPT_NAME with your department name (i.e. Computer Science) or your organization for whom you are developing this site
     
   - rtl with ltr, if you want your site to be in right to left languages.
   - set_time_limit(3600), with the wanted session time in seconds (after that the student will be logged out).
   
3. Edit the file "site_manager/pdoconfig.php" Insert there your Credentials to the database.
   - If you want to change the admin user, it should be synced with the [site manager](#site-manager).

4. Upload the site your website (to the directory defined at step 2.1).
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è: You MUST upload the site to the your main domain folder. Directories like "public_html/MyWebSite" won't work.
     
5. In your database admin (i.e. phpmyadmin): 
   - Download a ready empty database from databases folder.
   - Edit the file: change the database name according to the name your created.
   - Adjust the collation, charset (within the entire db file)
   - Import the database to your platform (i.e. phpmyadmin).
   
6.  Make sure to remove databases folder, guide.pdf, screenshot.png, README.md

## Site manager
In the site manager directory which inspired by the amazing [tinyfilemanager](https://tinyfilemanager.github.io/) your have config.php. 
Default username/password: **admin/admin123** and **editor/editor123**. The admin's password is synched with the one from step 3.

:warning: Warning: Please set your own username and password in `$auth_users` before use. password is encrypted with <code>password_hash()</code>. to generate new password hash [here](https://tinyfilemanager.github.io/docs/pwd.html)

To enable/disable authentication set `$use_auth` to true or false.

:information_source: You may edit any configuration you want there. 

:information_source: The editor will be able to access the file manager, only to the site directory (where the materials drive is located). Admin has access to the entire website, including the admin's panel.

## Drive
The main part of each student's site is the drive / materials section. Next to each new folder (by [site manager](#site-manager)), a directory browser file is auto created. You may modify it by modiying site_manager/index file (NOT index.php).

## Login
There are sections in the site which are limied to only students. For now, the sections are:
* Drive
* Grades panel
* Reviews panel
* Whatsapp panel

To add login protection you should use (don't forget to replace the constants here, like in step 2 of setup)
```php
function log_data($dir, $mail)
{
    require_once 'SITE_PATH/site_manager/pdoconfig.php';
    $conn = @new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);
    
    $sql = "UPDATE `Tusers` SET `last_dir`='$dir' WHERE `email`='$mail'"; 
    $conn->query($sql);
    $conn->close();
}

$server_root = 'SITE_PATH/';
$curr_dir = getcwd();
$representive_dir = str_replace($server_root, "", $curr_dir);
$representive_url = $_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME'].'://DOMAIN/'.$representive_dir;
$base_url = $_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME'].'://DOMAIN';

@set_time_limit(3600);
session_name("SESSION_NAME");
session_start();

if (!isset($_SESSION["SESSION_NAME"])){
    header("Location: https://DOMAIN/login/index.php?referer=$representive_url/");
    exit();
}

log_data($representive_dir, $_SESSION['SESSION_NAME']["mail"]);
```
