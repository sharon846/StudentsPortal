## Deploy by Docker

Make sure you have **already installed docker**, [Install reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

> **Notice:** Your need an absolute path, and it will be served by tinyfilemanager.
> 
> If you want to serve this project at **raspberry pi or another special platform**, you can download project and **build image by yourself**.

You can execute this following commands:

```shell
$ docker run -d -v /absolute/path:/var/www/html/data -p 80:80 --restart=always --name tinyfilemanager tinyfilemanager/tinyfilemanager:master
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
648dfba9c0ff   tinyfilemanager/tinyfilemanager:master   "docker-php-entrypoiâ€¦"   4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, :::80->80/tcp           tinyfilemanager

#### How to change config within docker

Origin:

```php
// Root path for file manager
// use absolute path of directory i.e: '/var/www/folder' or $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/folder'
$root_path = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];

// Root url for links in file manager.Relative to $http_host. Variants: '', 'path/to/subfolder'
// Will not working if $root_path will be outside of server document root
$root_url = '';
```

Modified:

```php
// Root path for file manager
// use absolute path of directory i.e: '/var/www/folder' or $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/folder'
$root_path = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/data';

// Root url for links in file manager.Relative to $http_host. Variants: '', 'path/to/subfolder'
// Will not working if $root_path will be outside of server document root
$root_url = 'data/';
```

Then, change another config what you want, and add a new volume `-v /absolute/path/index.php:/var/www/html/index.php` in `docker run` command, like this:

```shell
$ docker run -d -v /absolute/path:/var/www/html/data -v /absolute/path/index.php:/var/www/html/index.php -p 80:80 --restart=always --name tinyfilemanager tinyfilemanager/tinyfilemanager:master
```
